// AI, Agents & Hedera Services 

// A submission must: Hedera Deployment – Deploy Web3 components on Hedera Mainnet, Testnet, or Previewnet and utilise at least one Hedera service: Smart Contracts (EVM), Token Service, Consensus Service, Scheduled Transactions, or Mirror Node. AI Integration – Incorporate AI in a material way — e.g. LLMs, machine learning models, or multi agent systems. Open Source – Provide all source code in public GitHub repo(s) and verify any smart contracts on Hashscan. Demo Video – Include a demo video (≤ 5 minutes) explaining what was built and how to run it. Optional enhancements earn extra points: Using multiple Hedera services. Leveraging the Hedera Agent Kit or contributing new plugins/tooling for frameworks such as Eliza, LangGraph etc. Judging Criteria Innovation – originality of the idea Feasibility – technical viability Execution – completeness & code quality Integration – depth of Hedera usage Validation – market/user potential Impact – contribution to Hedera metrics (accounts, TPS, etc.) Pitch – clarity and persuasiveness of presentation
